# connected_graph_from_2d_map
This package automatically detects waypoints and converts your 2D map into a connectivity graph, that you can edit in real time using interactive markers in rviz, the output is saved in yaml. Generally, if there is a direct road or path between two waypoints in the image of the map then an edge is formed.
